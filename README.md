# linear_regression_applied
Repository created for practical application of regression modeling, based on the AI.Deep Learning ML course.

**dataset** : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rukenmissonnier/final-house

- **Linear_Regression_GD** :  Script made with the aim of modeling a linear regression manually, applying all the steps based on the calculations, and using Gradient descent to optimize the regression cost function. Furthermore, the results of the manual model are compared with the predefined sklearn models

- **Multivariable_LR** : Script made with the aim of modeling a linear regression of multiple variables manually, applying repetition loops and simultaneous parameter updates. Still using gradient descent for optimization, and applying regularization.
Also compared with sklearn models.
